As leaders of environmental activism we are often busy (seemingly more so these days). So much so that often we forget to wander, play and be amazed. Technology is moving forward and new, exciting and innovative ways to campaign present themselves. The global Greenpeace IT community had discussed moving tech into the future at its annual meet. One of the results of the Greenpeace IT Skillshare 2017 was the formation of the GP TechLab; a team to work with and discover new technologies to help save the planet in an entirely new way.
