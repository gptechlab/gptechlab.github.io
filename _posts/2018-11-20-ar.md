The impact of a single human being on the environment is hard to grasp. This is partly due to the long term effects of their current lifestyle, and also to layers of convenience, like flights and supermarkets, hiding the (potential) direct impact. This project tries to strip away these layers by presenting the user with a representation of their impact, depending on their current lifestyle, with the aid of augmented reality.

This project relies on the usage of a so called *marker*: ![marker](/assets/gp.png "marker"){:height="50%" width="50%"}

For that to work the user navigates to the hosting website via a QR code, and is then confronted with a questionair to determine the environmental impact. Following that, the devices camera should be pointed towards the marker, and the animation of an environment resembling the impact starts. Of course the user is able to share their impact via twitter and facebook.

The main components behind this project are [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) and [three.js](https://threejs.org/), by providing the functionality to animate and render 3D models. The models were created in [blender](https://www.blender.org/), a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset.
