Passbolt testing is underway! We have set up a small server and added a choice few suspects for sharing (non-essential) passwords with an aim to testing the system. [Passbolt](https://www.passbolt.com/). If you want to try, ping us an email at techlab@greenpeace.org and we will add you in. Please be aware that this is a trial service run and can be subject to downtime, dataloss and unreliability; use at your own risk!

Currently it works with Chrome and Firefox (as it requires a plug-in).
