The idea here was to create a platform over which a recorded video could be overlayed with useful information, quizzes, additional links or anything that could be considered beneficial to a training video. The essential parts here are being able to control the video and to be able to provide feature rich content at appropriate junctures in the training. While most of a good training video relies on being able to provide good content and structure, a tool like this provides the icing allowing students to be able to feel like they are more interactively participating that just passively watching.
